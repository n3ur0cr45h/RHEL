SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux) 
SELinux enforces a set of access rules that explicitly define allowed actions between processes and resources


Enforcing : SELinux enforces the loaded policies. This mode is the default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Permissive : SELinux loads the policies and is active, but instead of enforcing access control rules, it logs access violations. This mode is helpful for testing and troubleshooting applications and rules.

Disabled : SELinux is turned off. SELinux violations are not denied or logged. Disabling SELinux is strongly discouraged.
